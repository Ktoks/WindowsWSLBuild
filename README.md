> Run this command to get your WSL build set up for developing with Debian:
```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kacystocks/PublicMachineScripts/master/publicWSLBuild.sh | sh
```

> If you want an explanation of all of the commands used in this script, attached is a file called automateInstall.md you can read through, it will explain all of the steps in detail.
> I gave alternatives to the automated versions in there, so advanced users can customize their builds.
> You can also choose to install Ubuntu or another Debian-based distro by swapping out the 'Debian' parts for what you need for your chosen distro.
